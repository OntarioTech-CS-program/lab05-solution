## Lab Work

This lab is a combination of labs 3 & 4, the end goal being communication between your API from lab 3 and website from lab 4.

You will need to copy over the main files from labs 3 & 4 (e.g., java, javascript, CSS & HTML files) from the previous labs to
this lab.

```
lab 5
- api/ (lab 3)
	- .mvn/
	- src/
	- pom.xml
	...
- client/ (lab 4)
	- css/
	- cypress/
	- js/
	- index.html
	...
```

The page's existing functionality should still remain but whenever the page loads,
it should make an HTTP request to your API to populate the table.

>See the `readme.md` files in both subdirectories on how to properly modify your lab.
